                    and use of such other functionalities ofCred Buddha System as permitted byCred Buddha. For the

                <p>
                    You acknowledge thatCred Buddha allows you to submit a Credit Facility Application on the basis of a
                    determination made by and in such formats, methodologies, and algorithms inCred Buddha Systems only.
                </p>

                <p>
                    TheCred Buddha Systems undertake a dynamic evaluation of risk in relation to each Credit Facility
                    Application submitted by You based on various factors, including the amount of the Advance, the
                    credit eligibility parameters, and other requirements set
                    out by theCred Buddha Partner.Cred Buddha Systems may undertake a separate determination in relation
                    to each Credit Facility Application made by you. Given the dynamic nature of the determination made
                    byCred Buddha Systems, You acknowledge
                    that there is no assurance or guarantee thatCred Buddha shall allow you to submit a Credit Facility
                    Application for each and every Advance that you seek to avail.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You agree and accept thatCred Buddha or aCred Buddha Partner may, in its sole discretion, by itself
                    or through authorized persons, advocate, agencies, bureau, etc. verify any information given, check
                    credit references, employment details and obtain
                    credit reports to determine creditworthiness from time to time. The Service does not guarantee that
                    the Advance sought by You will be disbursed to You by theCred Buddha Partner.Cred Buddha will make a
                    preliminary determination of Your
                    creditworthiness in relation to every Advance sought by You and submit its determination in this
                    regard to theCred Buddha Partner. The final decision on whether or not to grant You the Advance will
                    rest with theCred Buddha Partner
                    and will be made usingCred Buddha Partner's credit decision processes and methodologies.Cred Buddha
                    Partner is free to reject any recommendation made byCred Buddha to it about processing of a Credit
                    Facility Application or grant
                    of Advance to You.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cred Buddha Partner will require You to submit further documentation, information, and details as
                    required under applicable laws and its internal policies before taking any decision about grant of
                    Advance to You. WhenCred Buddha Partner decides to
                    grant an Advance to You, it shall require that You execute a loan/credit facility agreement ("Loan
                    Documentation") with it to record the terms of the arrangement.
                </p>

                    in such manner as prescribed byCred Buddha Partner as and when it becomes due. Services ofCred
                    Buddha are only limited to connect you to the credit
                    providers, and the Services ofCred Buddha end the moment theCred Buddha Partner is connected to
                    You/You are connected to the Credit provider.
                </p>

                <h5>Separate Transactions:</h5>

                <p>
                    You acknowledge that an Advance disbursed under the Loan Documentation is a distinct transaction
                    between You andCred Buddha Partner, independent ofCred Buddha's Service. Any dispute betweenCred
                    Buddha Partner and you with respect to any Advance
                    disbursed to You must be directly settled betweenCred Buddha Partner and you, and that you will not
                    include or seek to includeCred Buddha in such dispute, failing whichCred Buddha shall be at liberty
                    to take any and all actions that
                    may be available to it to protect its interests.

                    reminders to yourself or to other persons who can be contacted byCred Buddha through you, whether or
                    not such other persons are
                    users of theCred Buddha System to the extent permitted under applicable law. You expressly
                    permitCred Buddha to use any or all of the information provided or generated by you forCred Buddha's
                    collections agency services in respect
                    of (a) any credit facility you may have availed from any credit issuing entity, irrespective of
                    whether or notCred Buddha facilitated the obtaining of such credit facility as provided for
                    elsewhere in this Agreement; or (b) any credit
                    facility availed of by a third party from any credit issuing agency whereCred Buddha's analysis
                    determines that the information you have provided toCred Buddha will enable it to contact such
                    person by either (i) deriving contact information
                    for such third party from the information provided by or generated by you and then contacting them
                    directly; or (ii) by contacting you and requesting if you will be willing to share contact
                    information for such third party or by requesting
                    you to inform such third party thatCred Buddha is attempting to contact her/him.
