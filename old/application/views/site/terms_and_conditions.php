                discretion) that it is appropriate, your ability to submit an application ("Credit Facility Application") for a short-term credit facility ("Advance") to a duly licensed entity who has partnered with Cred Buddha ("Key to Loans Partner")
                and use of such other functionalities of Cred Buddha System as permitted by Cred Buddha. For the avoidance of doubt, Cred Buddha is under no obligation whatsoever to reveal to you (including your nominees, heirs, and successors) its
                assessment of your creditworthiness at any point in time.
            </p>

            <p>
                You acknowledge that Cred Buddha allows you to submit a Credit Facility Application on the basis of a determination made by and in such formats, methodologies, and algorithms in Cred Buddha Systems only.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Cred Buddha Systems undertake a dynamic evaluation of risk in relation to each Credit Facility Application submitted by You based on various factors, including the amount of the Advance, the credit eligibility parameters, and other requirements set
                out by the Cred Buddha Partner. Cred Buddha Systems may undertake a separate determination in relation to each Credit Facility Application made by you. Given the dynamic nature of the determination made by Cred Buddha Systems, You acknowledge
                that there is no assurance or guarantee that Cred Buddha shall allow you to submit a Credit Facility Application for each and every Advance that you seek to avail.
            </p>

            <p>
                You agree and accept that Cred Buddha or a Cred Buddha Partner may, in its sole discretion, by itself or through authorized persons, advocate, agencies, bureau, etc. verify any information given, check credit references, employment details and obtain
                credit reports to determine creditworthiness from time to time. The Service does not guarantee that the Advance sought by You will be disbursed to You by the Cred Buddha Partner. Cred Buddha will make a preliminary determination of Your
                creditworthiness in relation to every Advance sought by You and submit its determination in this regard to the Cred Buddha Partner. The final decision on whether or not to grant You the Advance will rest with the Cred Buddha Partner
                and will be made using Cred Buddha Partner's credit decision processes and methodologies. Cred Buddha Partner is free to reject any recommendation made by Cred Buddha to it about processing of a Credit Facility Application or grant
                of Advance to You.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cred Buddha Partner will require You to submit further documentation, information, and details as required under applicable laws and its internal policies before taking any decision about grant of Advance to You. When Cred Buddha Partner decides to
                grant an Advance to You, it shall require that You execute a loan/credit facility agreement ("Loan Documentation") with it to record the terms of the arrangement.
            </p>

            <h5>Repayment:</h5>

            <p>
                You must repay the Advance along with all interest, charges, and fees payable to Cred Buddha Partner in such manner and at such times as stated in the Loan Documentation.
            </p>

            <h5>Default:</h5>

            <p>
                In the event You fail to make repayment as per the terms of the Loan Documentation, You agree that the Cred Buddha Partner and/or its authorized representatives may contact You in relation to recovery of the Advance and initiate necessary legal
                proceedings against you as deemed necessary.
            </p>
